### Bio

I am assistant professor at the Faculty of Education in Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Until recently I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Stanford Graduate School of Education working at the Center to Support Excellence in Teaching (CSET). My research focuses on teacher learning, professional development, collaborative learning mediated by digital technologies and research methodologies that involve developing sustainable innovations in collaboration with practitioners.

### Passions

Working with others to make things happen. Collaborating to create joint ways to address problems of teaching and learning practice. 

### Projects

* Problem Solving Cycle Project for mathematics teacher leaders in the San Francisco Unified School District. 
* Improving Practice Together Project to develop capacity in the Santa Clara Unified School District to implement a model that will support teachers' facilitation of science discourse and argumentation in classrooms from 3-5 grade.
